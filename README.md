# git-toprepo - Monorepo when your company won't let you

The `git-toprepo` tool acts like an automatic client side [`git-subtree`]
based on the submodules in a top repository. It will combine the history of all
the repositories and expand the content of the submodules to create an emulated
[monorepo].

Below, the term _monorepo_ is used as an abbreviation of
a _git-toprepo emulated monorepo_. See also [terminology].

## Getting started

`git toprepo init <repository> [<directory>]` will clone `repository` into
`directory`, replaces the submodule pointers with the actual content in the
repository history.

`git toprepo fetch [<remote>]` fetches from a `remote` and performs the
submodule expansion.

`git toprepo push [-n/--dry-run] <remote> <rev>:<ref> ...` does a submodule
split so that each submodule is pushed to its respective upstream repository. If
running with `-n` or `--dry-run`, the resulting `git push` command lines will be
printed but not executed.

## History combination strategy

The basic idea is to combine all the history from all the subrepositories in a
reproducible way. This means that even if users keep the emulated monorepository
locally on their own computers, they can still share monocommit
hashes with everyone else.

Consider the following history and commits:

    Top repo  A---B---C---D-------E---F---G---H
                  |       |       |       |
    Submodule 1---2-------3---4---5---6---7---8

The combined history will look like:

    Monorepo  A---B2---C2---D3--E5---F5--G7--H7
                  /          \  /     \  / \
                 1            D4       F6   G8

... and NOT like:

    BAD REPO  A--B2--C2--D3--D4--E5--F5--G7--H7
                 /\      /         \    /     \
                1  ------            E6       H8

The algorithm steps are:
* Any submodule history before the submodule is added to the top repository,
  contains the original submodule commits (`1---B2`).
* Empty edges for the submodule history are removed (`2---3`). Such empty edges
  would only pollute the graph. The monorepo history for the submodule directory
  would show there is no update between the two commits anyway.
* The top repo will keep the "first parent" line (`D3---E5`). D4 might not be
  buildable and would break `git bisect --first-parent`.
* Submodule changes are moved as late as possible before merging (`F6`). The
  alternative of `E6` instead of `F6` clutters the `git log --graph` view. From
  the top repo view, it is anyway impossible to know if `E6` or `F6` is better
  (buildable) or not.
* Unmerged submodule branches are branched as early as possible. It is easier to
  run `git checkout G8 && git rebase H7` than `git checkout H8 && git rebase H7
  --onto G7`.
* `FETCH_HEAD` from submodules are branched from the history of `HEAD`. As
  commit `7` can be used in multiple top repo branches, it is impossible to know
  which branch commit `8` is aimed for. Simply checkout a different monorepo
  branch and run `git toprepo fetch` to expand an unmerged submodule onto a
  different line of history.

## Configuration

The configuration is specified in [Toml](https://toml.io/) format. The location
of the configuration file is set in the `git-config` of the emulated mono
repository using `git config --local toprepo.config <location>` and takes the
following forms:

* `repo:<ref>:<path>`, a path in the tree of git ref,
* `local:<path>`, a file relative to the main worktree, and
* `worktree:<path>`, a file relative to the current worktree.

By default, the git-toprepo configuration is read from the committed `HEAD` in
the remote toprepo, i.e.
`repo:refs/namespaces/top/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD:.gittoprepo.toml`, but it is
possible to override it with a local path.

### Sub repositories

As `.gitmodules` evolves on the branches over time and the servers might be
relocated, the repository configuration shows how to access each sub repository
in the full history of the top repository. For example, multiple URLs might have
been configured in the `.gitmodules` file, but all of them refers to the same
repository.

Each submodule is fetched using `git fetch --prune <url>
+refs/heads/*:refs/namespaces/<repo-name>/heads/*
+refs/tags/*:refs/namespaces/<repo-name>/tags/*`. This makes sure that all
referenced commit ids that are reachable from heads and tags in the upstream
submodule will be expanded.

After each run of `git toprepo fetch`, the actually resolved configuration is
written to `.git/toprepo/last-effective-git-toprepo.toml`. This file includes
suggested `[repo.*]` additions to the `.gittoprepo.toml` configuration.

```
[repo.something]
urls = [
    "https://github.com/meroton/git-toprepo.git",
    "server.example/git-toprepo.git",
]
# Keep as a regular submodule when set to false.
enabled = true

fetch.url = "ssh://git@github.com/meroton/git-toprepo.git"
# Affects the --prune fetch arg, defaults to true.
fetch.prune = true
# --depth is added if set to non-zero.
fetch.depth = 0

# Commit ids that should not be expanded, they might e.g.
# be permanently missing from upstream.
skip_expanding = []

[repo.something.push]
# push.url defaults to fetch.url.
url = "ssh://git@github.com/meroton/git-toprepo.git"
args = []
```

## Git configuration

A strong recommendation is to keep the same branch names the same in all involved
repositories. The fetch code will work with any branch names,
but it quickly becomes very confusing which branch is which,
and the regular git push syntax with the remote branch
does not work well with different branches in different submodules.

### Gerrit Code Review

The following steps are required to operate a git-toprepo emulated monorepo.

* Create a toprepo: with the example name "my-only-toprepo".
* Enable [`config.submitWholeTopic`] to allow [submitting changes across
  repositories by using topics].
* Updating the project configuration, e.g. in
  `All-Projects.git:refs/meta/config`, to allow [superproject subscription to
  submodules updates]:
```
    [allowSuperproject "my-only-toprepo"]
        matching = refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*
```
* [Track `branch = .`] for all submodules in `.gitmodules` on all branches in
  the toprepo. This will make the super projects follow the same branch name as itself.

## Concepts

The following section describes the data model and the concepts involved in
working with git-toprepo. This has primarily been developed from available
server side features in the [Gerrit Code Review] system but is not restricted to
it. (Gerrit happens to be the authors' preferred review tool.)

The terminology used here often borrows from [Gerrit] and [Zuul CI].

> [!NOTE]  Some of the functionality is not yet released.

### Commits, topics and monocommits

Let's define a _topic_ as changes to be merged together in multiple
repositories, like Gerrit does. A topic may be cover multiple monocommits where
a monocommit contains commits within projects those projects are combined into a
monorepo through git-toprepo's history combination.

A picture is worth a thousand words:

![Concept overview](doc/static/toprepo-concepts.drawio.png)

This shows a purple topic that contains two monocommits: `A` and `B`. The `A`
monocommit spans two projects and the internal model keeps track of them
individually. Git-toprepo then pushes the _four_ commits to Gerrit and tracks
`A1`, `A2` and `B` as one topic. Because Gerrit only tracks dependencies (git's
parent relationship) within a project `C` is now shown to have `A2` as its
parent, `B` is not visible to `C` after the push within its project instead the
`C -> B` dependency is handled through the topic. We will dig deeper into this
later and cover how to go from right-to-left to download open changes from
Gerrit with git-toprepo.

#### Backend support

Gerrit is currently the only backend that supports submitting multiple changes
together. Therefore, git-toprepo only has support for querying Gerrit about
topic information. PRs for extending to other backends like GitHub and GitLab
are welcome.

ðŸš§ Gerrit topic integration is coming soon.

### Subprojects and Submodules

We prefer to talk about the repositories in Gerrit as projects, as that does not
denote whether they are combined into the monorepo history or are tracked as
regular git-submodules. It is common for a monorepo to eschew combining some
subprojects into the shared history, if they are very large and not actively
developed, for instance.

#### Commits

Commits are the bedrock of working with git. These are created in the individual
_subprojects_ or _submodules_ but multiple commits across different subprojects
can form one coherent _monocommit_. To form these is git-toprepo's core purpose,
to make cross-cutting changes across subprojects handled as individual commits
during development and in the combined history.

#### Monocommits

Monocommits is what we call commits created in the emulated monorepo either from
the combined history, where merges from the review system are bunched into one
atomic unit, or on-going work that may span multiple subprojects. It is not so
simple that a monocommit is always a Gerrit topic, though that is often the case
when using Gerrit for code review. A topic in Gerrit may under certain
circumstances be merged with additional commits that were (or were not) reviewed
to be merged together. As the review system owns the canonical git history we
follow its merge flow (autobump commits, submit-whole-topic, etc).

Monocommits are fundamentally a client-side construct. They are created either
when committing new work with `git-commit`, after fetching new history from the
remote, or by fetching on-going work from a colleague. In the latter case there
is no way to know precisely her working state before she pushed to Gerrit as we
have no way to communicate that. There is, however, a simple convention that
helps users collaborate. We will go through that in the example and
collaboration sections.

ðŸš§ Gerrit topic integration is coming soon.
https://github.com/meroton/git-toprepo/issues/121

##### Merged or unmerged

It is natural to make the distinction between merged and unmerged commits but it
is better to have consistent behavior. The goal here is to try to thread that
needle and communicate the subtleties of large scale collaboration.

The merged history is always the simplest: whatever was submitted together is
one monocommit, or a single commit if it was submitted independently, though
with __manual submission__ there are __rare exceptions__. So the split of one
topic into multiple monocommits is not performed in the filtered history.

Recall that a commit may be merged to the development branch but still be
in-review for a release branch. Then the filtered history on the client-side
contains both merged commits (master branch) and unmerged (development branch).
The developer may want to treat a given topic as multiple monocommits during
review for the development branch but they are originally one monocommit when
fetched from master.

#### Collaboration

There is a simple, not mandatory, convention to communicate the monocommits
meant to form a topic in Gerrit:

* Use the same commit message and change-id

Then, when a developer fetches the topic with git-toprepo, the [`recreate`]
strategy can be used to recreate the original working state. If the individual
commits in the topic were not created with git-toprepo, it is unlikely that they
would have the same change-id. In that case, the choice of [fetch strategy] is
less clear. To recreate monocommits means to treat each commit as their own
monocommit, allowing the developer to squash them manually after the fetch.
Instead, to squash the topic into one monocommit there are two other options:

* _squash-if-possible_: squash the topic into a single monocommit if it is
    possible. If there are multiple commits within a project this will instead
    give an error and the user will need to decide how to proceed.
* _force-squash_: squash the entire topic into a single monocommit. If there
    were multiple commits within a project their provenance will be tracked
    within the squashed commit message. But it is no longer possible to push
    changes to the original commits in Gerrit.

<!--       Do we want the list to include all of them? -->

ðŸš§ Gerrit topic integration is coming soon.
https://github.com/meroton/git-toprepo/issues/121

#### Topic

We use the [topic concept] from [Gerrit], the only platform that has custom
integration in `git-toprepo`. The topic is a way to indicate that many commits
should be _merged_ together. That means that all of the commits in a topic
should be submitted as one atomic unit to the history. As the review platform is
the canonical history one merged topic will create one monocommit in the
recombined history of the top repository.

https://github.com/meroton/git-toprepo/issues/121

[topic concept]:
    https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/intro-user.html#topics

### Commit messages and footers

The commit message for the merged monocommits is composed by all the contained
individual commit messages. Commit messages existing in multiple subrepo are
deduplicated and automatic messages like `Update git modules` are removed.

The format is not guaranteed to be stable but the information contained is meant
to reflect constituents:

* Commits in which subprojects
* Their individual commit messages

ðŸš§ Topic information is taken from Gerrit and is reflected in this message.

#### Zuul CI's dependency footers

Zuul CI has a dependency indication through [`Depends-On` footers] where a
commit can specify that it should be gated together with other commits.

ðŸš§ Zuul depends-on integration is coming soon.
https://github.com/meroton/git-toprepo/issues/122

[`Depends-On` footers]:
    https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/gating.html#cross-project-dependencies

#### Git-toprepo footers

On the client side, a few commit message footers are used. They are removed when
splitting mono commits, before pushing to any remote.

* `Topic: \<global-name\>` can be used to create a topic for one or multiple
  monocommits. This will not be pushed in the commit to the Gerrit backend.
  Other review system backends, when they are implemented, may need to keep this
  footer.

  The topic footer is also be written back during when combining the git
  histories.
* `Git-Toprepo-Ref: <path> <commit-id>` is added to be able to reconstruct the
  individual subrepo commits. Users also benefit in `git log` from being able to
  find out which the individual upstream commit ids.
